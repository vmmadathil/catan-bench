# Catan Bench Backlog

## TODO
- [ ] Visual board input mode (render board as image, pass to multimodal models)
- [ ] Add OpenAI/GPT models to benchmark config
- [ ] Trace analysis script for safety/alignment review (deception, collusion, sandbagging)
- [ ] Ablation: run with scratchpad/events toggled off to measure impact on ELO
- [ ] Suppress `google_genai` AFC log noise
